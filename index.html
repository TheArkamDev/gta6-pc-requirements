  <h4 style="font-size: 35px;">Can I Run GTA VI?</h4>
  <p style="text-align: center;">To run the GTA VI system requirements, we predict you will need an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 GPU, an Intel Core i5-6600K CPU, 12GB of RAM, and 150GB of SSD space.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) is highly anticipated for its return to the vibrant Vice City, expanding on the open-world gameplay and multi-protagonist storytelling that fans love. Expected to feature enhanced graphics, realistic environments, and a robust online multiplayer experience, the game aims to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment. Although Rockstar Games has yet to announce an official release date, the excitement continues to build as more details emerge about this next chapter in the iconic series.</p>

    With GTA VI in the works, but no official GTA VI PC requirements confirmed by Rockstar, we've analyzed the 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/QdBZY2fkU-0?si=aA-YrPqvg7x2Pv5r" target="_blank">GTA 6 trailer</a>, the chipsets inside current-gen consoles, and all the latest gameplay footage leaks to predict what we think the Grand Theft Auto VI system requirements will look like when the game launches in 2025. Thanks to recent footage, we're confident that Rockstar are utilizing a particular level of hardware for all of its playtesting, which has further informed our estimates.

  <h5 style="font-size: 35px;">GTA VI Size</h5>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Our estimated GTA VI size for download on PC comes in at 150GB of SSD storage. This estimate is based on the GTA VI game size which has been seen in various map leaks, and on the previous GTA V size requirements which came in at over 100GB of space. With our estimated GTA VI storage size being so high, we further estimate that an SSD will be part of the GTA VI specs. This shouldn't be too surprising to many, considering the ever-increasing presence of SSDs in the minimum requirements for many new games.</p>
